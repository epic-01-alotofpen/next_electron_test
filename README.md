This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project and electron app project.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

##  build

Regarding buiid, it is unclear whether this is a problem with the electron settings, but the contents of next.js are not displayed, so we are investigating.

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
# or
bun dev
```
